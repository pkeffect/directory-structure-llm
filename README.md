**Directory Controller** is a lightweight, cross-platform Python utility designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and your local file system.

It solves two specific problems:
1.  **Context Creation:** Turning your existing project structure into a clean text file to provide context to an LLM.
2.  **Scaffolding:** Taking a text-based directory tree generated by an LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek) and instantly building the actual folders and empty files.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Functionality
*   **Universal Parsing:** Intelligently parses various tree formats (Standard Tree `├──`, ASCII `+--`, Markdown Lists `-`, or Tab indentation).
*   **Smart Detection:** Automatically finds structure files (e.g., `structure.txt`, `tree.md`) without needing specific filenames.
*   **Auto-Scaffolding:** Creates directories and empty placeholder files based on the input map.
*   **Context-Aware:** Uses heuristics (file extensions, trailing slashes, indentation lookahead) to distinguish files from folders even if the LLM output is messy.

### New in v0.0.7 (Enterprise-Grade Safety)
*   **Gitignore Integration:** Respects your project's `.gitignore` file during scanning, automatically excluding build artifacts, logs, secrets, and temp files. Checks both **filenames** and **relative paths**.
*   **Infinite Loop Protection (Symlinks):** The scanner now detects Symbolic Links. It identifies them in the output (e.g., `link -> target`) but **stops recursion** immediately. This prevents the script from freezing on circular file paths or duplicating massive libraries.
*   **Smart Collision Resolution:** If you try to move a file to a folder where it already exists, the script **will not overwrite it**. Instead, it automatically renames the incoming file (e.g., `script.py` → `script_1.py`) to ensure zero data loss.
*   **Binary & Encoding Resilience:** The file reader now detects binary files (like images or compiled executables) and skips them instead of crashing. It also cycles through multiple encodings (`utf-8-sig`, `latin-1`) to handle files created in different environments (e.g., Windows Notepad).
*   **Root-Wrap Prevention:** Detects if the LLM has hallucinated a root folder that matches your current directory name. It automatically un-nests the structure to prevent `project/project/src` redundancies.
*   **Security Sanitization:** Aggressively filters file paths to remove directory traversal attacks (`../`) and characters invalid on Windows (`<>:"/\|?*`).

## 📦 Installation

1.  Ensure you have **Python 3.6+** installed.
2.  Download `directory-control.py`.
3.  Place the script in the **root folder** of your project.

---

## 📖 Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python directory-control.py
```

You will be presented with two options:

### Option 1: SCAN & GENERATE
**Best for: Giving context to an LLM.**

This scans your current directory to generate a file named `directory-structure.txt`.

*   **Clean Output:** It automatically filters out standard system junk (`.git`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`).
*   **Smart Ignoring:** It reads your local `.gitignore` file (if present) and excludes any matching patterns (e.g., `*.log`, `dist/`, `coverage/`) so you don't overwhelm the LLM with irrelevant file paths.
*   **Use Case:** Copy the content of this text file and paste it into ChatGPT/Claude so the AI understands your current project structure.

### Option 2: READ & BUILD
**Best for: Applying an LLM's architecture.**

This looks for a structure file (e.g., `structure.txt`, `tree.md`) and builds the file system.

1.  Ask an LLM to generate a project structure.
2.  Save the LLM's output into a text file (e.g., `structure.txt`) in your project root.
3.  Run the script and select **Option 2**.
4.  The script will:
    *   **Analyze:** Parse the text file and identify nodes.
    *   **Sanitize:** Clean up invalid characters and resolve root-wrapping issues.
    *   **Execute:** Create missing directories, create empty placeholder files, and move existing files to their new locations (with collision protection).

## 🧠 Supported Formats

The script uses a **Robust Parsing Engine** that ignores decorative characters and focuses on indentation. It supports all of the following styles:

#### Style A: Standard Tree (Common in Linux/DOS)
```text
project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
└── README.md
```

#### Style B: Markdown Lists (Common in ChatGPT)
```text
- project
    - src
        - main.py
        - utils.py
    - README.md
```

#### Style C: ASCII Art (Old school)
```text
project
|-- src
|   +-- main.py
|   +-- utils.py
+-- README.md
```

## ⚙️ How it Works (The Logic)

When parsing a text file, the script must decide if a line represents a **File** or a **Directory**. Since LLM output varies, the script uses the following logic hierarchy:

### 1. Classification Logic
1.  **Explicit Syntax:** If the name ends with `/` or `\`, it is a **Directory**.
2.  **Extension Check:** If the name has a file extension (e.g., `.py`, `.json`, `.js`), it is a **File**.
3.  **Indentation Lookahead:** If line `A` is followed by line `B`, and line `B` is indented *deeper* than line `A`, then line `A` is treated as a **Directory** (files cannot contain children).
4.  **Common Naming Conventions:** If ambiguous, names like `src`, `dist`, `bin`, `assets`, `config`, `tests` are treated as **Directories**.

### 2. The "Smart" Security Layers (v0.0.7)
*   **Non-Destructive Operations:**
    *   This script **NEVER deletes files**.
    *   This script **NEVER overwrites files**. If a move operation conflicts, it renames the file to `filename_1.ext`.
*   **Root Wrapper Detection:**
    *   *Problem:* You are in `my-app`. The LLM outputs a tree starting with `my-app/src/...`.
    *   *Old Behavior:* You ended up with `my-app/my-app/src/...`.
    *   *New Behavior:* The script sees the top-level node matches the CWD name, ignores the top node, and maps `src` directly to the current directory.
*   **Path Sanitization:**
    *   Leading slashes (`/var/www`) are stripped to force relative paths (`var/www`).
    *   Windows-invalid characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`) are stripped from filenames to prevent OS errors.
    *   `..` is removed to prevent directory traversal attacks.
*   **Symlink & Binary Safety:**
    *   The scanner detects symbolic links and refuses to follow them, preventing infinite loops.
    *   The file reader checks for binary content (Null bytes) to prevent the script from trying to parse images or executables as text.

### 3. Exclusion Mechanisms
*   **System Exclusions:** The script explicitly ignores its own source file, `.git`, `node_modules`, `.env`, `.DS_Store`, and `__pycache__` to prevent clutter.
*   **Dynamic Exclusions (Gitignore):** The script parses your `.gitignore` using wildcard matching (`fnmatch`). It checks patterns against the **filename** (e.g., `error.log`) AND the **relative path** (e.g., `build/output/main.js`).

## 🤖 Prompting Advice

To get the best results from your LLM, use a prompt like this:

> "Generate a directory structure for a [Python/Node/etc] project. Please output the structure as a standard ASCII tree or a Markdown list. Ensure folders end with a slash '/'."

**Example of ideal input text file:**
```text
/my-app
    /backend
        server.py
        config.py
    /frontend
        index.html
        styles.css
    README.md
    .env.example
```
